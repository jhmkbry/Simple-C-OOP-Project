Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#
This repository contains a simple C# code example demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
In this example:A class Animal is defined with properties (Name and Age), constructor, and a method (MakeSound).
An object of the Animal class is created in the Main method, and its properties are set.
The object's method MakeSound is called to demonstrate encapsulation and abstraction in OOP.
Feel free to explore and use this code to understand the basics of OOP in C#!
